      <p>To start my design process, I first began by analyzing the data that the dataset I chose offered. From there, I was able to form 2 questions
        I wanted answered with my visualization. The first one was which video game platform actually sold the most amount of units? The second
        was which video game genre was most likely to create the most sales.
      </p>
      <p>
        After assessing the information, I noticed that the best type of visualization to use to represent the data would be a bar graph.
        Although the bar graph does a great job of giving a general range of where the sales are, I wanted to offer a more accurate depiction
        for users to be able to see. To accomplish this, I added a hover effect using D3's tooltip. Now when users hover over the category, they 
        will be able to see precisely the number of units sold. 
      </p>
      <p>When choosing a color scheme for the chart as well as the website, I decided it would only be fitting to use a video game color 
        palette. The palette I chose is reminiscent of the old school Nintendo consoles such as the Gameboy and NES. I feel the colors used
        are catching to the eye, while also not being too overwhelming and difficult to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the visualization I used did answer the questions I had proposed. I found it very interesting that despite it's age and newer
        consoles coming out, the Play Station 2 is still far and away the most bought console of all time. One thing that did surprise me about
        the genre sales is that Sports games are more popular than Shooters. I had always assumed that Shooters were if not the most popular, the
        second most popular. This visualization allowed me to discover some interesting facts about the industry I have invested a lot
        of my time in!
